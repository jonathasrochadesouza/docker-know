## üîç Summary

</div>

This repository contains Docker configurations and commands for various application components, including backend services, frontend applications, and fullstack setups. It provides a practical guide for containerizing different parts of a web application using Docker and Docker Compose.

The project includes:
- Backend service with Node.js and MongoDB
- Frontend application with React
- Fullstack setup with Docker Compose

Each component has its own Dockerfile and configuration, demonstrating best practices for containerizing web applications.

## üöÄ Introduction

</div>

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers allow developers to package an application with all its dependencies and ship it as a single unit.

> **Note:** When working with Docker, always start by finding an appropriate base image on Docker Hub that matches your application's requirements.

The first step in creating a Dockerfile is to look for a base image on Docker Hub and copy the specific name.

## üå¥ Docker Principles

</div>

Docker has four principles.

### 1. Image üíø

An image refers to the configuration of a container, it is the base image to run the container. The image contains the configuration base and/or an application and its entire environment.

### 2. Container üß∞

A container is the coupled image running in execution, and can be accessed.

### 3. Newtwork üõú

It is the network used by the application running in the container, this includes the port and the docker network settings created for the application to run on top.

### 4. Volume üé≤

A volume refers to a data allocation created and managed by Docker. It is not deleted when deleting a container or image. Volumes can be created for databases, file storage, or similar purposes for running containers.

## üñ•Ô∏è Essential Docker Commands

</div>

This section covers fundamental Docker commands for building, managing, and running containers and images.

### Build an Image

Use this command to build a Docker image from a Dockerfile in the current directory. Replace `[image_name]` with your desired image name.

```bash
docker build -t [image_name] .
```

Example for backend:
```bash
docker build -t jonathasrochadesouza/backend .
```

Example for frontend:
```bash
docker build -t jonathasrochadesouza/frontend .
```

### List Images

Displays all locally available Docker images.

```bash
docker images
```

### Run a Container

Starts a new container from an image. The `-p` flag maps ports (host:container), and `-d` runs the container in the background (detached mode).

```bash
docker run -p [host_port]:[container_port] [image_name]
```

To free the console CLI, add the `-d` flag:
```bash
docker run -d -p [host_port]:[container_port] [image_name]
```

If an error occurs due to version (e.g., Node.js):
```bash
docker run -e "NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider" -p [host_port]:[container_port] [image_name]
```

Example for backend:
```bash
docker run -p 4000:4000 jonathasrochadesouza/backend
```

Example for frontend:
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 jonathasrochadesouza/frontend
```

### Check Running Containers

Lists all currently running Docker containers.

```bash
docker ps
```

### Stop a Container

Stops a running container using its ID or name.

```bash
docker stop <container_id_or_name>
```

### Remove an Image

Removes a Docker image. Ensure no containers are using the image before removing it.

```bash
docker rmi <image_id_or_name>
```

### Force Stop a Container and Remove Image

Forces a container to stop and, if necessary, removes the associated image.

```bash
docker kill <container_id_or_name>
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Docker Compose Commands

</div>

This section details commands for managing multi-container applications using Docker Compose.

### Build Images (Compose)

Builds or rebuilds services defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

For all services:
```bash
docker-compose build
```

For individual services (e.g., `mongo`, `app`, `client`):
```bash
docker-compose build [service_name]
```

Example:
```bash
docker-compose build mongo
```

### Start Services (Compose)

Creates and starts containers for all services defined in `docker-compose.yml`. The `-d` flag runs in the background.

For all services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

For individual services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d [service_name]
```

Example:
```bash
docker-compose up -d app
```

### Stop Services (Compose)

Stops running services without removing the containers.

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

### Stop and Remove Services (Compose)

Stops and removes containers, networks, and volumes created by `up`.

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### View Logs (Compose)

Displays logs for all services or a specific service.

For all services:
```bash
docker-compose logs
```

For a specific service:
```bash
docker-compose logs [service_name]
```

## üì¶ Overview of Swarm

</div>

Docker Swarm is Docker's native orchestration tool, designed to group and manage multiple hosts (called nodes) into a single, cohesive cluster. As the default solution, it comes installed and enabled by default with Docker.

The primary feature of Swarm is the creation of an overlay network that connects all nodes. This allows containers, even if running on different physical machines, to communicate transparently and securely as if they were on the same local network.

Nodes can connect to each other. A container within a node can connect to a container on another node.
