## üîç Summary

</div>

This repository contains Docker configurations and commands for various application components, including backend services, frontend applications, and fullstack setups. It provides a practical guide for containerizing different parts of a web application using Docker and Docker Compose.

The project includes:
- Backend service with Node.js and MongoDB
- Frontend application with React
- Fullstack setup with Docker Compose

Each component has its own Dockerfile and configuration, demonstrating best practices for containerizing web applications.

## üöÄ Introduction

</div>

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers allow developers to package an application with all its dependencies and ship it as a single unit.

> **Note:** When working with Docker, always start by finding an appropriate base image on Docker Hub that matches your application's requirements.

The first step in creating a Dockerfile is to look for a base image on Docker Hub and copy the specific name.

## üñ•Ô∏è Essential Docker Commands

</div>

This section covers fundamental Docker commands for building, managing, and running containers and images.

### Build an Image

Use this command to build a Docker image from a Dockerfile in the current directory. Replace `[image_name]` with your desired image name.

```bash
docker build -t [image_name] .
```

Example for backend:
```bash
docker build -t jonathasrochadesouza/backend .
```

Example for frontend:
```bash
docker build -t jonathasrochadesouza/frontend .
```

### List Images

Displays all locally available Docker images.

```bash
docker images
```

### Run a Container

Starts a new container from an image. The `-p` flag maps ports (host:container), and `-d` runs the container in the background (detached mode).

```bash
docker run -p [host_port]:[container_port] [image_name]
```

To free the console CLI, add the `-d` flag:
```bash
docker run -d -p [host_port]:[container_port] [image_name]
```

If an error occurs due to version (e.g., Node.js):
```bash
docker run -e "NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider" -p [host_port]:[container_port] [image_name]
```

Example for backend:
```bash
docker run -p 4000:4000 jonathasrochadesouza/backend
```

Example for frontend:
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 jonathasrochadesouza/frontend
```

### Check Running Containers

Lists all currently running Docker containers.

```bash
docker ps
```

### Stop a Container

Stops a running container using its ID or name.

```bash
docker stop <container_id_or_name>
```

### Remove an Image

Removes a Docker image. Ensure no containers are using the image before removing it.

```bash
docker rmi <image_id_or_name>
```

### Force Stop a Container and Remove Image

Forces a container to stop and, if necessary, removes the associated image.

```bash
docker kill <container_id_or_name>
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Docker Compose Commands

</div>

This section details commands for managing multi-container applications using Docker Compose.

### Build Images (Compose)

Builds or rebuilds services defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

For all services:
```bash
docker-compose build
```

For individual services (e.g., `mongo`, `app`, `client`):
```bash
docker-compose build [service_name]
```

Example:
```bash
docker-compose build mongo
```

### Start Services (Compose)

Creates and starts containers for all services defined in `docker-compose.yml`. The `-d` flag runs in the background.

For all services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

For individual services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d [service_name]
```

Example:
```bash
docker-compose up -d app
```

### Stop Services (Compose)

Stops running services without removing the containers.

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

### Stop and Remove Services (Compose)

Stops and removes containers, networks, and volumes created by `up`.

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### View Logs (Compose)

Displays logs for all services or a specific service.

For all services:
```bash
docker-compose logs
```

For a specific service:
```bash
docker-compose logs [service_name]
```
